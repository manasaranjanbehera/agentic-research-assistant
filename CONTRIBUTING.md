## Development setup

```bash

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` only if you plan to run live Bedrock calls locally.
Tests do not require AWS credentials.

```bash
make lint
make test
```

Or directly:

```bash
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run pytest -v
```

CI runs automatically on pull requests (Ruff + pytest on Python 3.10–3.12) and
must pass before merge.
